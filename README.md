We built a android application- a GUI interface which will give us control on the plane in FlightGear   
simulator.
Our program is based on the MVVM (Model, View and View Model) design pattern. 
Acorrding to MVVM rules, we created 3 main packages for the Model, View and View Model. The Modle responsible on the logic of our program, the View is responsible to display our program and the ViewModel create the connection between the model and the view.
Moreover, our program can control the aileron, throttle and more indices of the plane in FlightGear simulator. 
The main Class in our program are the MainActivity that in the view package.
For more information on the classes and functions, see the documentation in the code.
our application is working from jdk version 8 and from Android 10 (API 29).
